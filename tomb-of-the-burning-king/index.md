# Tomb of the Burning King

**Location:** 
**Last Explored:** 2025-10-xx by 

About five centuries ago, a king was burried here. The real details of his life are lost to only very learned scholars. Locals call him the burning king, because of the carving in the entry. Only recently was the secret of entrance learned. Locals recall three regal treasures: a sword, a crown, and a ring, none of which have eer been found. 

In the surrounding area, kobold are common. In the tomb, skeletons and a strange shadowy ghost are found frequently. One room has flaming lizards. Deep in the tomb is a labrynth, with traps and many dangerous enemies. A band of mercinaries has been seen exploring the dungeon.
